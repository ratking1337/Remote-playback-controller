# Remote-playback-controller
I've decided to write this script because I don't have a 3.5 port on my (android) phone, and 3.5 -> TypeC adapters are garbage. The concept is to share a hotspot to a laptop and then use android terminal (termux, nethunter or whatever) to control music playback on the laptop
